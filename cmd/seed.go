// seedCmd represents the seed command
var seedCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "seed",
	Short: "generate hex seed from mnemonic",
	Long: `This command generates hex seed from mnemonic and optional passphrase.

Hex seed is directly used for key generation and should therefore be treated as
a secret material.

Please note that the seed is always generated for the English equivalent mnemonic
if the input mnemonic language is different from English.

The language needs to be one of the following:
1. English (default)
2. Japanese
3. ChineseSimplified
4. ChineseTraditional
5. Czech
6. French
7. Italian
8. Korean
9. Spanish

Mnemonics are always reformatted using sentence fields and are not affected
by extra white spaces. They are, however, case sensitive. For instance, following
mnemonics are all the same. Note, how white spaces at the beginning, end or
in between fields are ignored.
