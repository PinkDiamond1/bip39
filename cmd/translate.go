	Use:   "translate",
	Short: "Translate mnemonic between languages",
	Long: `This command translates mnemonic from one language
to another in the sense that it preserves the underlying entropy:

The language needs to be one of the following:
1. English (default)
2. Japanese
3. ChineseSimplified
4. ChineseTraditional
5. Czech
6. French
7. Italian
8. Korean
9. Spanish

Mnemonics are always reformatted using sentence fields and are not affected
by extra white spaces. They are, however, case sensitive. For instance, following
mnemonics are all the same. Note, how white spaces at the beginning, end or
in between fields are ignored.
